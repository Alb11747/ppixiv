This library opens a standalone terminal window that can be read and written to.  It can be
used for debugging and log windows.  It's a massively stripped-down fork of Putty.

Using console windows for this (AllocConsole, etc.) works, but has too many warts, such as
unceremoniously killing the host application if the window is closed.  It's cleaner to just
create our own window.
